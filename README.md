\##japanese on Freenode IRC is a channel where members can learn or practice
their Japanese with natives and proficient learners.


## Channel basics

The members of ##japanese are a casual bunch, and we talk about a variety of
subjects. Don't be afraid to interrupt with a question related to Japanese.

Discussions related to Japanese and Japan have priority over others, which can
continue in \##japanese-offtopic to accomodate everyone's needs.

Write Japanese with at least [kana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana) if you
can.

People will try to help you by fixing your sentences in Japanese or in
English, explaining or pointing to relevant documentation. You are welcome to
do so as well. Caution is advised on the reliability of this advice, and we
encourage stating one's doubts when explaining something.

Our bot K5 offers features such as dictionary lookups. If not relevant to the
conversation, use them in private messaging with the bot.

Avoid flooding, listen to others, and remember we're here for Japanese!


## Encoding
To display Japanese, your chat client must use UTF-8. We don't use ISO-2022-JP
